# Scorpion-Engine
A 3D game engine made with Javascript. Scorpion makes it easy to set up scenes, cameras, and objects using only one line of code.

For example, this whole scene is creted using only **4 lines of code.** Using vanilla three.js, this would take over **20** lines of code:

### Features/Uses:
I created this engine as an easy way for newcomers to take advantage of Three.js. The Three.js library is a very rich and detailed library which I initially found overwhelming. I used this project as an excuse to jump head first into the world of Three.js and the world of 3D in the browser in general. I am still learning and implementing new things as I learn, any pointers would be much appriciated!

Scorpion was designed for people like me who are used to programming with vanilla JavaScript and who haven't really gotten into a bunch of the big 3rd party libraries. When starting to learn Three.js, I found that even a lot of the simpler things I wanted to do, such as just creating a simple cube with a simple material, was very challenging since I had never dabbled in 3D before. Cameras, scenes, and meshes all seemed like a concept I understood, but I found that there was a lot of deeper concepts involved in creating each of these things with standard Three.js.

Because of this, when I started to learn I set up my workflow in a way that made it easier for me to get simple tasks done using only a single line of code for each task I wanted to get done. If I wanted to make a scene, all I had to do was call one function with a bunch of variable parameters and Three.js handles the rest. This made it easy for me to just get what I wanted to get done with my vanilla JS experience while also taking advantage of a powerful library like three.js.

There's still a lot of work to be done, and I'm not the best at Three.js still. But I'm learning with this project and I hope this project can help some people who feel the same way!
